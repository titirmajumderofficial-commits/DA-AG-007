        "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including the noise and random fluctuations, to the point where it performs poorly on new, unseen data..An overfit model has high variance and low bias.It is detected when the model shows very high accuracy on the training set but significantly lower accuracy on the validation or test set.\n",

        "To prevent and detect these issues, one key technique is to manage the bias-variance tradeoff.Overfitting can be prevented by regularization techniques (like L1 or L2 regularization) which penalize complexity, by gathering more training data, or by simplifying the model..Underfitting is prevented by using a more complex model, introducing more relevant features, or reducing regularization.Cross-validation (eg, K-Fold) is a primary method for detection, as it allows for testing the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data, providing a more robust estimate of its generalization error."

        "Compare Min-Max scaling and Standardization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature scaling is an essential preprocessing step in machine learning that involves transforming the range of independent features to a standardized range..It is crucial because many ML algorithms rely on calculating the distance between data points or depend on the magnitude of feature values.Without scaling, features with larger initial magnitudes (eg, 'Salary' in the tens of thousands) would dominate the distance calculation over features with smaller magnitudes (eg, 'Years of Experience' from 1 to 20), leading to a model that is heavily biased towards the larger-scale features..This impact is particularly significant for distance-based algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM)..Furthermore, for algorithms that rely on iterative optimization like Gradient Descent (used in Linear Regression and Neural Networks), unscaled features can cause the optimization path to oscillate wildly, resulting in slower convergence or failure to find the optimal solution.\n",

        "Comparison of Min-Max Scaling and Standardization\n",
        "Min-Max Scaling (Normalization) and Standardization (Z-Score Normalization) are two common techniques used in machine learning to scale features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Min-Max Scaling (Normalization)Min-Max Scaling transforms the data such that all feature values ​​fall within a specific fixed range, typically [0, 1] . The formula used for this transformation is$X_{new} = \\frac{X - X_{min}}{X_{max} - X_{min}}$. This technique is generally preferred when the data distribution is not Gaussian or when clear boundaries, such as minimum and maximum values, are required, as is often the case in image processing. A significant drawback, however, is that Min-Max Scaling is highly sensitive to outliers . Since the transformation is based on the maximum and minimum values, outliers can drastically compress the range of the majority of the data points, reducing the effective distinction between non-outlier values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Standardization (Z-Score Normalization)Standardization rescales the data so that the resulting distribution has a mean ($\\mu$) of 0 and a standard deviation ($\\sigma$) of 1 . The formula for Standardization is$X_{new} = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$. This method is preferred when the feature distribution is approximately Gaussian (normal) or when the model requires normally distributed inputs, such as in Linear Discriminant Analysis. Unlike Min-Max Scaling, Standardization is less affected by outliers because the transformation does not constrain the data to a fixed, predefined range."

A good example is 'Education Level,' where categories naturally progress (eg, High School < Bachelor's < Master's). By assigning sequential integers (eg, 0, 1, 2) to these categories, Label Encoding naturally captures this relationship, making the encoded variable useful for the machine learning model.\n",

In this case, using Label Encoding would mistakenly introduce a false sense of ordinality (eg, implying 'City 2' is somehow 'greater' than 'City 1'), which can confuse and mislead the model. One-Hot Encoding avoids this problem by creating separate binary columns for each category, ensuring that all categories are treated as independent entities."
